As of right now (Sep. 15th) the client and server both run and can
speak to eachother on port 5000 of localhost. 

This is a battleship game that can be played across two computers if
both computers are running a server and a client. The servers and 
clients comunicate with eachother using POST and OK requests with 
http protocol. 

To run it you will need two people to run both the client and server
simultaniously.
